# Symbolic Debugging

12 June 2025

## Idea:

Use symbolic predicates to identify when/why RL agents fail. Automatically detect patterns like "agent fails when color(enemy, red) AND size(enemy, large)."

* Debugging tools are always useful
* Clear value proposition for practitioners
* Can work with any exisiting RL algorithm
* Easy to construct failure cases for testing
