# Symbolic Regularization

12 June 2025

## Core Idea: 

Add regularization terms to standard RL loss functions that enforce symbolic consistency. If an agent learns a symbolic rule (like "if door is locked, use key"), penalize actions that violate this rule across similar states.


## Why It's Novel
Current RL approaches either:

* Use pure neural networks (no symbolic constraints)
* Do full neuro-symbolic integration (complex architectures)

**Gap**: No one has explored using symbolic rules as soft constraints in standard RL training. You'd be the first to add symbolic consistency as a regularization term.

## Implementation Concept

```python
# Standard RL loss
policy_loss = -log_prob(action) * advantage

# Add symbolic regularization
symbolic_loss = consistency_penalty(state, action, learned_rules)
total_loss = policy_loss + λ * symbolic_loss
```

**Example**: Agent learns "if has_key AND door_locked → use_key_action". The regularizer penalizes the agent for taking other actions in states where this rule should apply.

## Why It's Useful/Impactful

### Sample Efficiency:
Symbolic constraints guide exploration and prevent the agent from "forgetting" useful patterns
Interpretability: Discovered rules explain agent behavior

### Transfer: 
Rules learned in one domain can regularize learning in similar domains
Safety: Symbolic constraints can encode safety rules

## Implementation Simplicity
* Week 1: Implement rule extraction from successful episodes
* Week 2: Design consistency penalty functions
* Week 3: Integrate with standard RL algorithms (PPO/A2C)
* Week 4: Experiments + comparison with unregularized baselines

Key Advantage: Just adding loss terms to existing algorithms. Much faster to implement and debug.

## Concrete Example

In gridworld navigation:

* Agent discovers rule: "if wall_ahead → turn_left OR turn_right"
* Regularizer penalizes going forward when wall detected
* Results: Faster learning, fewer collisions, transferable navigation rules
