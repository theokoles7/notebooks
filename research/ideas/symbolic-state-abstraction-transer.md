# Symbolic State Abstraction for Transfer

12 June 2025

## Idea:

Learn symbolic state abstractions that enable zero-shot transfer between similar tasks. Agent trained on "red key opens red door" immediately knows "blue key opens blue door."

* Builds on established state abstraction literature
* Easy to construct controlled experiments showing transfer
* Concrete metric: performance on unseen color combinations
