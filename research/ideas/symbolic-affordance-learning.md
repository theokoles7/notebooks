# Symbolic Affordance Learning

12 June 2025

## Idea:

Learn object affordances (what actions are possible) using symbolic predicates. Instead of learning "I can push this specific object," learn "I can push objects where movable(X) AND size(X, small)."

* Affordance learning is well-established in robotics/cognitive science
* Clear success metrics (transfer to new objects)
* Can start with simple predicates and show compositional affordances

Most affordance work is perception-based, not symbolic predicate-based.
